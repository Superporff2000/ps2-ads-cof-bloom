## Abstract

Planetside 2 provides the Census API to provide statistical and character-specific information for all players, server-specific territory status as well as names, descriptions and icons of all items within the game.

## Goal

Use this API to pull data on a player's current weapon $WEAP and weapon's CoF $COF, then output these in the terminal.
